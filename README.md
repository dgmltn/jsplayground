Proof of concept that allows executing javascript code at runtime.

TODO: finish `QuickJs.attachHelpers()` in [ziplineExt](/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/util/ziplineExt.kt)

Several ideas for "helpers":

* implementation of "alert" in the host
* implementation of "fetch"
* other platform features (gps, reading contacts, reading files, etc)
